# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Feb 17, 2017

  + Version up due to the daqtoolbox update

  
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Feb 10, 2017

  + All time records are now stored as floating-point numbers in BHV.

  
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Feb 6, 2017

  ~ Fixed that the transparent color key was hard-coded as black.
   (Thanks for neo3dot1415 from the ML forum)
  
  ~ VC++ 2013 Redistributable is now correctly detected in the 32-bit MATLAB.
  

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Jan 30, 2017

  + Improved detection of Visual Studio Redistributable and DirectX.
  
  + embedtimingfile.m minifies runtime files better.

  + Faster response when the control screen is dragged during calibration

  
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Jan 5, 2017

  + Now both manual and automatic eye drift corrections work, whether the eye
   calibration is used or not. For manual correction, press the 'c' key during
   the trial and then the eye position at that moment becomes the new origin,
   (0,0). If 'c' is pressed mistakenly, the change can be reverted by 'u'. (You
   can undo multiple times.) The automatic correction takes into account all
   fixation points where eyejoytrack() with 'holdfix' was finished succesfully
   and now uses a much simpler algorithm that requires the adjustment magnitude
   parameter only.
   
  + MATLAB UI controls in the control screen now display the information of
   the current trial, not the previous trial. (Thanks to Joshua Aman)
  
  ~ Frame skipping during the joystick cursor update is not warned anymore.
   (Thanks to kms from the ML forum)
   
  ~ The reward time records kept during initialization are now being deleted
   correctly before the first trial begins.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 23, 2016

  + Now the STM object takes the third argument in the condition file that
   indicates whether it needs to be triggered multiple time in one trial. If
   the argument is 0 or not given, the STM object is disabled after one firing
   as in the old ML with MATLAB's DAQ toolbox. This change is for making it
   possible to trigger Reward via AnalogOutput after Stimulation is done.
   
  + embedtimingfile.m is rewritten to add the customizable reward function to
   the runtime. And it now removes trailing single line comments as well.
   

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 21, 2016

  ~ A problem that crashes MATLAB R2014b-R2015aSP1 in a certain monitor
   configuration under the 100% DPI mode is fixed. It was because my code that
   worked around a bug in those MATLAB versions was not perfect and detected
   the screen coordinates incorrectly. (Thanks to Xiaomin Yue)
  
  ~ Now the output pulse of eventmarker() is enforced to be at lease 125 us.
   Otherwise, event codes may not be registered in a fast system due to the too
   short pulse length. (Thanks to Sebastien Tremblay)
   
  ~ Now Reward can be triggered with the STM object via AnalogOutput, if
   toggleobject() is called before goodmonkey(). This is the same behavior as
   the old ML does. (Thanks to Sebastien Tremblay)

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 16, 2016
  
  + Now BHV.AbsoluteTrialStartTime records the elapsed time from the task start
   in milliseconds. Previously this field was filled with the system clock
   reading, but the system clock is vulnerable to many unauthorized changes and
   therefore the name, "absolute time", was misleading. The system clock is
   stored in BHV.TrialDateTime instead.
   
  + Now user-defined functions in the timing file can be inserted into runtimes
   properly. Those functions must be defined at the end of a timing file and
   terminated with 'end'.
   
  + Now NIMH ML does not copy CondSelectFunction, BlockSelectFunction,
   BlockChangeFunction, UserPlotFunction, etc. to the RuntimeDirectory and
   reads directly from the ExperimentDirectory, where the timing and condition
   files are placed.
  
  + Unnecessary initialization sequences were removed for the fast startup.
  

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 15, 2016

 + Support for customizing the reward function, goodmonkey(). See
  reward_function.m. Also multiple digital lines can be assigned to "Reward"
  now.
  
 ~ A problem that stops the task when STM objects are not used during the trial
  is fixed. (Thanks to Joshua Aman)


# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 12, 2016

 + Now ML can run with one monitor for the testing purpose. In that case, the
  subject screen is replaced with a 1024x768 window.
  
 + The 2-D Spatial Transformation tool supports keyboard manipulation (N key,
  P key). (Suggestion from Xiaomin Yue and Sebastien Ballesta)
  
 ~ Some code in the calibration tools was re-written for old MATLAB versions.
  (Thanks to Wing from the ML forum)
 

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Dec 1, 2016

 + The subject screen is now created as a full-screen window. This helps ML
  keep up with the refresh rate of the screen without disabling Desktop Window
  Manager or even when the control screen runs at a different refresh rate.
  (Thanks to Sebastien Tremblay)
 
 ~ A sound can be added from a row vector now, which fixes an error occuring
  when a SND object is created from a sine wave. (Thanks to Soo Hyun Park)

 
 # Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Nov 9, 2016

 ~ The problem that MonkeyLogic Latency Test cannot be initiated when the
  selected calibration is not complete is fixed.
 
 ~ The error that occurs when Online Smoothing is selected is fixed.
 

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Nov 7, 2016

 + The subject screen is not re-drawn unless there is any change. This improves
  performance when there is no movie presented.
   
 ~ A hole in the thread safety that can crash MATLAB during movie presentation
   is fixed. This fix affects all previous versions, so everyone should update.
   
 ~ The benchmark test shows the results in the same way as in the old ML, for
   easier comparison.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Nov 3, 2016

 ~ The problem that the new commands make an error when there is no movie
   stimulus in the condition is fixed.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Nov 1, 2016

 + Added a new command, get_movie_duration(object_num, time_in_msec), which
   returns the legnth of the movie in milliseconds.
   
 ~ The problem that sometimes MATLAB stalls when movie objects are removed
   is fixed.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Oct 28, 2016

 + Added a new command, rewind_movie(object_num, time_in_msec), which moves the
   current position of the movie to the given time.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Oct 24, 2016

 ~ Some bugs in UI are fixed.

 
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Oct 21, 2016

 + The maximum numbers of buttons and general inputs that can be connected are
   increased to 10 and 16, respectively.
 
 + USB joysticks are supported. When both analog joystick and USB type are
   available, the USB type takes precedence.
   
 + The Origin-Gain calibration tool allows negative gains to flip the polarity
   of input signals. 


# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Oct 19, 2016

 + A message is displayed on the control screen when escaping the trial loop is
   requested either by typing the ESC key or calling escape_screen().
 
 ~ The calibration tools are now working with old MATLAB versions.

   
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Oct 17, 2016

 + Vertical syncing during movie playback is improved.
 
 + The eye & joy calibration tool is improved. Fixation cues can be triggered
   with mouse clicks. Also a new calibration function is added.
   
 + Online analoginput smoothing is supported.

 + During the simulation mode, each button can be simulated individually with
   keys 1-0 and is on only while the key is pressed.


# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Aug 10, 2016

 ~ Fixed a "missing field" error that occurs when setting DAQ from scratch
  (Thanks to Helen Schwerdt)
  
 ~ Fixed a bug that crashes MATLAB when bitmaps are added
  (Thanks to Yang Zhou and David Freedman)
 

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Aug 2, 2016

 + While running trials, the computer does not go to sleep or turn off the
   screens. 

 ~ Audio initialization is skipped, when there is no available endpoint device.
 
 ~ Fixed an instability issue during movie playing.

 
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Jul 29, 2016

 + The properties such as 'MovieStartFrame', 'MovieStep', 'StartPosition' and
   'PositionStep' are supported in toggleobject() again.
   (However, 'MovieSrartFrame' and 'MovieStep' make playback speed dependent on
   the refresh rate and therefore should be avoided.  Plus, the entire movie
   should be small enough so that all the frames can be loaded in the memory.
   The current limit is 16 MB, but it can be changed in mgladdmovie.m)
   
 + Non-streaming movies can use set_frame_order() as well.
 
 ~ The bug that stops ML when eyejoytrack() is called before toggleobject() is
   fixed. (Thanks to Yang Zhou and GuilHem Ibos)
   
 ~ The bug that the editable variable window becomes unclickable is fixed.
   (Thanks to Yang Zhou and GuilHem Ibos)
 
 ~ The problem that ML requires eye input during SIMULATION MODE is fixed.
   (Thanks to Helen Schwerdt)
 
 ~ Conversions of figure coordinates between MATLAB and Windows is improved.
   (Thanks to Ben Basile)
 

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Jun 29, 2016
 
 + support for alpha blending
   Now the unfilled pixels of fix, crc and sqr are transparent to the
   background in all MATLAB GUIs and task screens.  This is supported in pic as
   well, if your image files have alpha channel data that MATLAB can read. 

 + support for mouse/touchscreen input
   Now mouse/touchscreen input is available and you can choose on the main GUI
   whether to save mouse trace/click data in the BHV file.  No DAQ setting is
   required to activate mouse/touchscreen.
   This function is forward compatible with previous versions of the
   touchscreen MonkeyLogic, so you can run and read the timing and BHV files
   written from previous MonkeyLogic, but the data file generated by NIMH
   MonkeyLogic is not readable in the old versions (not backward compatible).
   
 + In the simulation mode, you can use the mouse cursor moves and clicks to
   emulate gaze position and screen touch.  Now the joystick cursor is
   controlled by the cursor keys, instead of num arrows, and the buttons are
   toggled by the space key, not by the combination of the space and backspace.
   
 + Now the stm objects can be triggered multiple times, not just once.
 
 + You can choose the shape, color and size of the fixation point and the
   joystick cursor on the main menu.
 
 ~ Although the online manual says the size of the crc object is specified in
   radius in the condition file, the number is internally considered a diameter.
   This is fixed, but will increase the size of your crc objects.  The sqr
   objects are not affected.
 
 ~ To support mouse/touchscreen input and multiple stm triggering, NIMH
   DAQ Toolbox (included) is required now.  NIMH MonkeyLogic no longer works
   with MATLAB DAQ Toolbox.
  
 - The A-I duplication button is removed from the main GUI and now analog
   input is sampled from only one NI board, even if there are two.  NIMH DAQ
   Toolbox does not need two boards to support near-realtime acquisition.
   See daqtoolbox\doc\NIMH DAQ Toolbox.pptx for the details.
 
 - MLHELPER.exe, prttoolbox and all other keyboard and mouse hooks are removed.
   Now you can type and click while MonkeyLogic is running.  To keep timing
   accuracy, however, close other programs and don't do unnecessary
   keyboard/mouse manipulation.
   

# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, Jun 6, 2016

 + Supports low-latency audio output based on XAudio2.
 
 + Supports movie streaming. There is no limit in the duration of movies that
   can be played.

 
# Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic, May 19, 2016

 + new graphic library (MonkeyLogic Graphic Library, MGL)
 
  > Written with 3D APIs

  > Supports any screen resolution and any refresh rate, including the portrait
    orientation

  > No more multiple flickerings before starting a task

  > What you see is what your monkey sees (WYSIWYMS).  The control screen
    displays the same scene as the subject screen.

 + changes from the previous version
 
  > If you are using the photodiode trigger, check if its size becomes smaller
    in NIMH Monkeylogic.  The old graphic library required the size of bitmaps
	to be a multiple of 4, so the previous MonkeyLogic made the trigger size
	bigger than the specified size while padding additional pixels around.
	Since MGL does not have such a requirement and there is no more padding,
	the trigger may become smaller under the same size setting.
  
  > MLHELPER.exe, prttoolbox and all other keyboard and mouse hooks have been
    obstacles for MonkeyLogic to behave as a normal Windows application.  They
    are all temporally blocked in this release and will be removed in the
    future.  Now it is your duty to close all other applications before
    running MonkeyLogic, not to slow it down.

  > This version includes NIMH DAQ Toolbox and uses it by default, although it
    still works with MATLAB DAQ Toolbox.  MATLAB DAQ Toolbox may not be used
    with NIMH MonkeyLogic in the future, because it does not update data
    samples fast enough and does not support some devices like mice or USB
    joysticks. 

	 
# First release of NIMH MonkeyLogic, Apr 7, 2016

 + combined the following three previous distributions.

  > The "Oct 2014" version from the official website
   (which is not available any more as of 3/22/2016)

  > AsaadLab's 2/16/2016 version
   (https://bitbucket.org/asaadneurolab/monkeylogic-asaadlab)

  > FreedmanLab's 5/9/2014 version
   (https://github.com/Dfreedmanlab/MonkeyLogic_stable)
   
 + fixed known problems

  > Vijay's patch for slow graphic updating that occurs in R2014b and later
   (http://forums.monkeylogic.org/post/long-cycle-latencies-7783430?pid=1290048064)
   This patch helps, but it works by decreasing the quality of the control
   screen graphics and yet the performance is still unsatisfactory.

  > Jaewon's patch for Behavioral Codes not being assigned correctly.
    (http://forums.monkeylogic.org/post/errors-in-the-current-ml-package-7752047?pid=1290922224)
   This patch allows you to add Behavioral Codes across multiple digital ports.

  > No more funky business with the MATLAB pref setting! Now RunTimeDirectory
    is determined based on the location of currently running MonkeyLogic, when
	there are multiple copies installed.

  > Video writing in Behavior Summary is changed to make video compression
    actually work.

  > Graphic properties deprecated in HG2 graphics are updated. 

  > Now only one 'default_cfg.mat' is created in the base directory.

  > lots of other minor fixes
