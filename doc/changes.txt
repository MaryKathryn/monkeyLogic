 + New adapters, TextGraphic and CurveTracer, are added.

 + A new example task, task\runtime v2\curve trace, is added.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 25, 2018)

 - A memory leak that occurred when the SND objects were created from vectors,
   not from files, is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 23, 2018)

 - The data file recorded with SmoothPursuit is replayable now.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 19, 2018)

 - A problem that EyeLink DLLs are not loaded when mlplayer is called before
   monkeylogic is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 17, 2018)

 + New adapters, FreeThenHold & SmoothPursuit, are added.

 + A new example task, task\runtime v2\pursuit eye movement, is added.

 - A problem in the eye auto drift correction of trialholder_v2 is fixed.

 
* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 8, 2018)

 - The problem that trialholder_v2 shows an error ("Index exceeds Matrix
   dimensions. (mlaq.get.Button, Line 273)") when buttons are defined is fixed.
   (Thanks to aboharbf from ML forum)

 - An error that occurred when reading bitmap images with paletted colors is
   fixed.

 - A problem that movie playback stops when there is a missing frame in the
   video is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jan 4, 2018)

 + ML2 can record signals during inter-trial intervals now. A new checkbox
   option to activate this feature is added on the main menu. Extra analog
   samples acquired during ITI will be added to the beginning of the next
   trial's data segment. Also all the events of the next trial will be timed
   from the ITI start, as if the trial is delayed by the ITI. The AISampleRate
   will be fixed to 1000 Hz, when this option is turned on.

 + A new function, mlconcatenate, is added to read analog data as one long
   seamless array across all trials. This function also converts the timestamps
   of all events to absolute trial time measured from the task start. To read
   data files with mlconcatenate, the sample rate of the data must be 1000 Hz. 
   ML2 uses the CPU clock to time events, while analog signals are digitized
   based on the NI board's clock. Typically there is a few nanosecond
   difference between those clocks, which results in a missing/extra sample
   every few minutes. To avoid this temporal error being accumulated,
   mlconcatenate takes the CPU clock as a base and fills the missing NI samples
   with the ones immediately preceding or discards the extra NI samples. If you
   are using a signal processing system, like Plexon or TDT, it is recommended
   to feed all your signals to the system and let them recorded there so that
   all samples are digitized based on the same clock.

 + NIMH daqtoolbox provides a couple of new methods to improve timing accuracy.
   For example, flushdata() is a function that removes previously collected
   samples. ML2 uses this function to mark the location of the very first
   recorded sample, by calling it when the trial clock starts. When multiple
   adapters are used, however, there is an inevitable time gap between flushing
   the first adapter and the last one, which can be longer than 1 ms if there
   are too many samples to delete or just because MATLAB is too slow. To reduce
   this gap, I added flushmarker(), a function that quickly scans adapters and
   just marks the positions to flush without removing samples yet. Since the
   function does not perform the time-consuming part itself, it can return
   within a millisecond even when it is called for the first time. Then, actual
   sample removal can be performed later by flushdata(), when the time accuracy
   is not critical.
   
   % old way
   start(DAQ);
   flushdata(DAQ);
   timestamp = toc(global_timer); % You want this timestamp to be close to the
                                  % moment of flushing the first adapter in DAQ
   % new way
   start(DAQ);
   flushmarker(DAQ);              % flushmarker() is faster so the gap with the
   timestamp = toc(global_timer); % timestamp is much shorter.
   flushdata(DAQ);                % Old samples collected before flushmarker()
                                  % are flushed here.

 - The problem that the calibration tools show a warning message at the space
   key press in the Dec 14, 2017 version is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Dec 14, 2017)

 + Now ML2 supports Ethernet links for Arrington ViewPoint Eye Tracker & SR
   Research EyeLink series. To enable the Ethernet link, go to the "Non-DAQ
   Devices Settings" on the ML menu and choose one in the "TCP/IP Eye Tracker".
   Non-DAQ devices have priority over DAQ devices, when they both are set in
   the Input/Output menu.

 + Touchscreens that use Windows's native driver can be supported now. To
   enable this feature, go to the "Non-DAQ Devices Settings" on the ML menu and
   check on "Touchscreen". It will activate a side menu, "Run Message Loop".
   Then, check on that side menu, too. Although this will fix the previously
   reported problem, you should not turn on this "Run Message Loop" option, if
   your touchscreen works fine without it.

 - The problem that SingleTarget's Success becomes empty when there is no input
   data is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Dec 1, 2017)

 - A typo in Line 70 of run_time.m that stopped the latency test & IO test is
   fixed. (Thanks to aboharbf from ML forum)

 + Functions that simulate Stimulation and TTL are included. They replace the
   output channels/ports during the simulation mode, but do not send out actual
   signals. May not work in all cases.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Nov 28, 2017)

 + analogoutput of NIMH daqtoolbox is updated so that it can quickly stops and
   retrigger output for closed loop stimulation. An example task is in the
   "task\runtime v2\8 closed loop stimulation" directory.

 - The problem that occurred when trying to use a rectangular fixation window
   with eyejoytrack() is fixed. It was a side effect of the recent graphic
   library update for the runtime v2. (Thanks to aboharbf from ML forum)


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Nov 21, 2017)

 + Now you can make ML2 send out notifications to your Slack apps. Obviously
   this requires an internet connection to your ML2 computer and you need to
   download the Slack app on your smartphone or desktop. See alert_funcion.m
   for the instructions. If you want different notifications for different
   tasks, make a copy of alert_function.m in your task directory and modify the
   copy. Don't forget to turn on 'Alert' on the main menu.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Nov 20, 2017)

 + All adapters are re-written to inherit from their superclasses.

 + In the original ML, only numeric scalar variables can be editable, but, in
   ML2, strings can be editable as well. Now ML2 can have 3 special types of
   editable variables: -file, -dir and -color. If variables are declared as
   editables with these keywords, users can use MATLAB's file dialog or color
   pick-up dialog to set the variables.

   editable('-file','parameter_file');
   editable('-color',{'face_color','edge_color'});

 + Now editable variables can be accessed from userloop via TrialRecord (read
   only). For example, the editables defined in the timing file as shown above
   can be read in the userloop like the following.

   TrialRecord.Editable.parameter_file
   TrialRecord.Editable.face_color
   TrialRecord.Editable.edge_color


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Nov 9, 2017)

 + A problem that mlplayer sometimes crashes MATLAB when it is closed during a
   playback is fixed.

 + It is found that VC++ 2013 Redistributable (x64) - 12.0.40649 uses a
   different uninstall signature. The new signature is added to ML, but, in
   case that it changes again, users can choose to bypass the detection code.

 + New adapters and task examples

 - repmat(A,1,1,3) is not compatible with R2013a or earlier, so changed to
   repmat(A,[1 1 3]). (Thanks to Xiaomin Yue)


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Nov 2, 2017)

 + An edit field for JuiceLine is added to all reward argument dialogs.

 + During the reward polarity test, the number of triggered reward drops is
   displayed along with JuiceLine and Duration. You can also stop the test in
   the middle by pressing the ESC key. This is for those who use the test for
   reward calibration.

 + The JuiceLine of the manual reward ('R' key) during user tasks is determined
   as given in the reward argument dialog of the main menu.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Oct 30, 2017)

 + Now goodmonkey() can deliver rewards in the non-blocking mode. When the
   'nonblocking' argument is non-zero (1 or 2), goodmonkey() returns the
   control immediately and triggers rewards in the background process.
   This non-blocking mode is for giving rewards while continuously updating
   visual stimuli, for example, during a movie playback. Therefore, it is most
   useful when you write tasks with the new trialholder_v2 and is not necessary
   in a usual situation. If you use the non-blocking mode, make it sure that
   the task continues long enough to finish all background reward delivery.
   Otherwise, some reward events may be stampted after the trial end code (18).

   goodmonkey(100, 'numreward',3, 'pausetime',300, 'nonblocking',1);

   Here is the list of the arguments that goodmonkey() can take:

   NumReward  : number of drops
   PauseTime  : interval between drops, in milliseconds
   TriggerVal : triggering voltage for analogoutput
   JuiceLine  : reward channel to trigger, for digitalio only
   EventMarker: behavioral code(s) to stamp for each drop
   NonBlocking: 0 (blocking, by default)
                1 (non-blocking, yield to other threads, less precise timing)
                2 (non-blocking, do not yield, more precise timing)

   JuiceLine, EventMarker and NonBlocking are not remembered by goodmonkey(),
   unlike NumReward, PauseTime and TriggerVal, and need to be set every time
   when goodmonkey() is called.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Oct 23, 2017)

 - ML2 made an error while staring a task, if mlplayer was running already.
   This error was patched in the previous version, but the patch was not perfect
   and introduced another bug. Now all things work fine.

 - A mistake made in the eye drift correction of the trialholder_v2 is fixed.
   To use the eye drift correction in trialholder_v2, the WaitThenHold adapter
   must be used.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Oct 20, 2017)

 - The structure of the adapters (building blocks for creating scenes in
   trialholder_v2) is straightened out for unified interface.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Oct 17, 2017)

 + The control screen backround is supposed to be blue only when the trial is
   running and gray otherwise. This works correctly now.

 + A new trialholder function, bhv_code, allows you to add BehavioralCode
   within the timing file.

   bhv_code(code_number1, code_name1, code_number2, code_name2, ...);

 - Fixed that mlplayer doesn't use the actual refresh rate and therefore
   replays trials incorrectly under a certain condition.

 - Minor changes & fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Oct 12, 2017)

 + mlplayer can replay datafiles created with the new trialholder (v2).

 + Better handling of skipped frames for long movies

 - Minor changes & fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Sep 27, 2017)

 - There was a mistake in sorting the screen device order, so the fix related
   to the main menu position was not working perfectly. Now it is patched.

 - get_movie_duration() was retuning the number in seconds. Now it returns the
   length in milliseconds.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Sep 25, 2017)

 + A new example task (shapes) that demonstrates how to draw arbitrary-shaped
   stimuli is added.

 - Minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Sep 22, 2017)

 + A new trialholder (a.k.a. runtime) is added. This new trialholder provides a
   way to detect complex behaviors and control dynamic visual stimuli. See the
   example tasks included (dms with new runtime, random dot motion and timer
   demo). Detailed documentation will be added later.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Sep 20, 2017)

 - The problem that the mlplayer screen doesn't come back when "Export to AVI"
   is cancelled is fixed.

 - In previous versions, movies are rewound automatically when they are toggled
   off so that they can be reused in the same trial. This introduces a
   unnecessary delay when the movie is big. Now users have to explicitly rewind
   them with rewind_movie().

 - When a new configuration profile is created for a new subject in previous
   versions, the menu settings are copied from the last subject's profile, but
   the editable variables of the new profile are reset to the values defined in
   the timing file. Now the editable variables are also copied from the last
   subject's profile.

 - Minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Aug 25, 2017)

 + reward_function.m supports multi-channel reward devices via multiple digital
   lines by default. To trigger a different reward channel, use the 'juiceline'
   option as below.

   goodmonkey(100,'juiceline',2);      % trigger Reward 2 for 100 msec
   goodmonkey(100,'juiceline',[1 3]);  % trigger Reward 1 & 3 simultaneously

 + Now gray-scale bitmap files can be used. (Thanks to Xiaomin Yue)

 + Now the ML main menu shows up on the screen where the command window is
   located (Thanks to Sebastien Ballesta)

 + Quotation marks (double or single) added to each field in the conditions
   file are processed properly now. (Thanks to hoptman from ML forum)

 - Minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 24, 2017)

 - The problem of the space origin floating when the slip correction is made by
   the 'C' key during the 2-D spatial transformation calibration is fixed.
   (Thanks to Carlos Ponce)


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 19, 2017)

 + The pause menu items are mouse-clickable now.

 + A button to reset eye/joystick calibration is added to the main menu.

 + When the calibration tools are closed without saving the changes, a question
   dialog will be pop up to confirm.

 - A testing code accidentally inserted in the sound module is removed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 17, 2017)

 + Image Processing Toolbox is not requied any more, even when the 2-D Spatial
   Transformation is used for the calibration.

 - The origin-gain calibration supports the rotation manipulation, to
   compensate the distorsion in the input signal due to, for example, the
   tilted eye camera. 

 - All calibration methods, including 'Raw Signal', allow the temporary
   rotation of the space with the following command. This change is reset in
   the next trial and, for the origin-gain calibration, its effect is
   additional to the rotation change during the calibration.

   EyeCal.rotate(degree);
   JoyCal.rotate(degree);


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 12, 2017)

 - The imresize() function used in the recent releases is replaced with
   mglimresize(), which is not dependent on Image Processing Toolbox.

 - NIMH daqtoolbox prints out more detailed information for NI-DAQmx errors.

 - The default input range of analoginput is changed to [-10 10] for better
   compatibility with MATLAB DAQ.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 7, 2017)

 + The main menu GUI can be collapsed so that ML2 can be run on a smaller
   screen (1024 x 768).

 - Minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jul 5, 2017)

 + The I/O test panel is added. This panel is accessible from the main menu and
   users can test analoginput (eye, joystick, touch, etc.), stimulation and TTL
   with it.

 - Minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jun 30, 2017)

 - When stimuli are pre-loaded with the userloop and not turned off by the end
   of a trial, they can show up in the next trial. To prevent this, pre-loaded
   stimuli are deactivated at the end of each trial.

 - The problem that SND created from wav data, not from the file, does not play
   is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jun 27, 2017)

 + mlplayer can handle repositioning of visual objects, frame manipulation of
   movies and background color changes. It is required to record data with this
   version of ML (or later), to get those features replayed correctly.

 - Movie-related codes are refactored. Decoding is twice faster now.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Jun 13, 2017)

 + The trial replay tool, mlplayer, is added.

 - The problem that the conditions are not refreshed when the block is switched
   is fixed (Thanks to Sheena from the ML forum).


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (May 25, 2017)

 + mlbhv2.m caches the positions of the variables in the file and improves the
   reading speed after the first access.

 - The problem that structure arrays are read backward from the data file
  (bhv2, h5) is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (May 18, 2017)

 + Support for individualized configurations and editable variables. When a
   conditions file is selected, the very last saved configuration is loaded by
   default. Then, the configuration for a particular subject can be chosen by
   changing the subject name.

 + When the data file with the same name exists already and the user chooses
   overwriting, the old file is moved to Recycle Bin rather than deleted
   directly. The question dialog is updated to show the choices and actions
   more clearly.

 + The following keyboard controls work in both origin-gain and 2-D spatial
   transform calibration methods now.

   r: manual reward
   -: decrease reward duration by 10 ms
   =: increase reward duration by 10 ms
   c: eye slip correction
   u: undo eye slip correction

 + The eye offset at the time of the slip correction during trials (manual
   correction by the 'c' key or auto drift correction) is recorded to the data
   file.

 - Many minor fixes


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (May 11, 2017)

 + Now the behaviorsummary shows the figure drawn by the userplot function, if
   the function is provided.

 + Another reward mode is added to the 2-D spatial transform calibration, in
   which the fixation cue moves to the next calibration point upon the space
   key press.

 - The gain range in the origin-gain calibration is increased from [-10 10]
   to [-20 20].

 - The index of the currently selected calibration target was not updated
   appropriately in the 2-D spatial transform calibration, if a target was
   chosen by a mouse click. As a result, when the target presentation was
   resumed by the keyboard, the target adjacent to the previously selected one
   was displayed, instead of the one adjacent to the current target. This
   problem is fixed now.

 - The problem that the reward function did not get custom reward variables
   when it was tested from the main menu is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (May 8, 2017)

 + STM and TTL can be triggered in the simulation mode now, if actual hardware
   exists.

 + Reward on & off times are recorded even when the Reward I/O is not assigned.

 + As in the ML1, 'reward_dur' is defined as an editable variable by default
   and its value can be increased/decreased by 10 with the '-' & '=' keys.

 + If the DAQ boards indicated in the loaded configuration do not exist, the
   configuration is not automatically saved when the run button is clicked.
   This prevents the I/O mapping in the configuration file from being
   overwritten when the task is temporarily tested in a different computer.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (May 2, 2017)

 + The reward count is displayed above the water drop icon now.

 - The conditions file header items that contain spaces before and after them
   are read correctly now. (Thanks to Ben Basile)

 - The fixation target in the 2-D transformation calibration is turned off
   when a reward is delivered with a space key press. (Thanks to Ben Basile and
   crponce)

 - Calibration points in the 2-D transformation calibration can be toggled off
   even when they are not currently on the fixation points.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Apr 21, 2017)

 + Now the length of the strobe pulses can be customized in the main menu,
   according to the required specification of the recording system.

 - Now eventcodes are marked in the behavioral data file, even though the
   'Behavioral Codes' and 'Strobe bit' are not assigned in the main menu. The
   reward-on and -off times of goodmonkey() still won't be recorded unless
   'Reward' is assigned.

 - A problem that ML couldn't parse out the pic object description when the
   width and height were given as decimals. This happens when the conditions
   file is generated with a script provided in the original ML.

 - get_analog_data() is fixed to receive the name of the General Input signals
   in the original ML's convention, like 'gen1'. (Thanks to Soohyun Park)

 - Fixed an error in the DirectX 9 detection


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Apr 12, 2017)

 - An error that occurred during manual eye/joystick drift correction while
   using 2-D Spatial Transformation is fixed. (Thanks to crponce from the ML
   forum)

 - The previous patch related to movie presentation introduced a new bug that
   disabled the movie preview. It is fixed now.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Apr 10, 2017)

 + Now the fixation threshold of eyejoytrack() can be specified as a rectangle
   with a two-element vector. (Thanks to SeanC from the ML forum)

 + An option that delivers reward on typing the space key is added to the 2-D
   Spatial Transformation calibration tool. (Thanks to crponce from the ML
   forum)

 - The fixation window sizes in the calibration tools are fixed to be radii
   correctly. The sizes of all circle objects in NIMH ML2 are represented in
   radius.

 - A problem that movie objects couldn't be turned off when they ended before
   the duration of idle() or eyejoytrack() is fixed.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Apr 5, 2017)

 + Added the following new fields to Screen and TrialRecord to improve the
   compatibility with old timing scripts.

   Screen.BackgroundColor
   Screen.PixelsPerDegree
   TrialRecord.DataFile


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 31, 2017)

 + Now pre-loading stimuli and timing files is possible when running the task
   with a userloop file so that the required ITI can be minimized
   (See the included example task, movie preloading. Thanks to mkytch from the
   ML forum)

 - Fixed the problem with "Chart Blocks" that occurs when multiple block
   numbers are given in one condition line. (Thanks to mkytch from the ML
   forum)


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 28, 2017)

 + Changed the name convention of the cfg file from '*_cfg.mat' to '*_cfg2.mat'
   so that the old cfg files are not overwritten. The old cfg files are not
   compatible with NIMH ML 2.

 - Fixed the problem that the location of the user plot was incorrect in old
   MATLAB versions.

 - Fixed the problem that the background color of the subject screen does not
   change during the idle command, when there is no object to update. (Thanks
   to Xiaomin Yue)

 - Fixed an error made in the previous version that prevented editable
   variables from loading


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 27, 2017)

 + Now the behavior summary is shown at the end of tasks, as in the previous
   versions.

 - An error made in the previous version that disables Stimulation and Mouse
   is fixed.

 - The timing accuracy of goodmonkey (reward on/off time and eventmarker) is
   improved.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 24, 2017)

 - Fixed an error in assigning strings that contain commas and semi-colons to
   editable variables.

 - Fixed the problem that the simulation mode did not work with Stimulation
   and TTL.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 22, 2017)

 - Fixed the problem that TrialRecord.CurrentConditionStimulusInfo does not
   reflect the taskobject info correctly. (Thanks to crponce from the ML forum)

 - Fixed the problem that the x & y positions of gen objects defined in the
   conditions file are provided as char, not numeric. (Thanks to neo3dot1415
   and crponce from the ML forum)

 - Fixed the problem that the intertrial-interval is not counted for the
   duration specified by set_iti().


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 20, 2017)

 + Due to the just-in-time compilation of MATLAB, the timestamps of eventmarker
   were off by a few milliseconds from the actual flip times of toggleobject
   for the first few trials, until all the codes were compiled and cached. Now
   stimulus presentation (Stimulations, TTLs, and audio sounds) and timestamp-
   marking are processed at the DLL level without going through MATLAB scripts
   so that there is no such delay any longer.

 - An error made in the previous release is fixed. It prevented the changes of
   timing files from being applied immediately.


* Changes in NIMH MonkeyLogic 2 (Mar 17, 2017)

 + Improved support for the userloop function (see the 'dms with userloop'
   example in the task directory for further details)

 + Made the sizes of all circle-shaped objects represented in radius
   irrespective of their units. This makes the fixation point and the
   eye/joystick/touch tracers almost twice bigger when you change their shape
   from Square to Circle without adjusting their sizes. However, it is
   consistent with the fact that the CRC objects in the conditions file and the
   window threshold of eyejoytrack() are also in radius and therefore less
   confusing.
