% This example shows how to send out waveforms through analog channels with
% manual triggers.
%
% When TriggerType is Manual, waveforms are loaded with START command but
% generation of them is postponed until TRIGGER is issued. This
% significantly reduces the latency of waveform output.
%
% To generate the same waveform multiple times, set RepeatOutput to a
% number bigger than 0.

[y,fs] = audioread('C:\Windows\Media\notify.wav');
y2 = audioread('C:\Windows\Media\tada.wav');

ao = analogoutput('winsound',0);
addchannel(ao,1:2);	% The first channel in winsound devices is 1, not 0.

ao.TriggerType = 'Manual';
ao.SampleRate = fs;
ao.RepeatOutput = 0;

putdata(ao,y);
putdata(ao,y2);
